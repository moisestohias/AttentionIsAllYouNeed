In the possitional encoding layer Why this `x = x + (self.pe[:, :x.shape[1], :])` instead of `x + self.pe` or `x + self.pe[:x.size(0), :]`.

# Exlanantion
1. **Shape of `self.pe`:** The positional encoding matrix `self.pe` has a shape of `(1, T, D)`, where `T` is the maximum sequence length and `D` is the dimension of the encoding.

2. **Shape of `x`:** The input `x` has a shape of `(Batch, seq_len, d_model)`, where `Batch` is the batch size, `seq_len` is the sequence length of the current batch, and `d_model` is the model's dimension.

3. **The expression `self.pe[:, :x.shape[1], :]`:** This slices the positional encoding matrix to match the current sequence length `x.shape[1]`. The resulting shape will be `(1, seq_len, d_model)`, which aligns with the shape of `x`.

4. **Why not `x + self.pe`?** Using `x + self.pe` without slicing would only work if the sequence length of `x` is exactly `T`. If the sequence length of `x` is less than `T`, this would result in a shape mismatch error.

5. **Why not `x + self.pe[:x.size(0), :]`?** This expression would attempt to slice the positional encoding matrix along the batch dimension, but `self.pe` only has a single batch dimension (of size 1). This would also result in a shape mismatch.

In summary, the expression `x + (self.pe[:, :x.shape[1], :])` ensures that the positional encoding is correctly aligned with the current batch's sequence length, allowing for variable-length sequences. It adds the positional encoding to each sequence in the batch without any shape mismatch.

```py
class TorchPositionalEncoding(nn.Module):
    """ This is for the case where the batch is second x(T, N, D) """
    def __init__(self, D, T, dropout = 0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=dropout)
        position = torch.arange(T).unsqueeze(1)
        div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, D, 2) * (-math.log(10000.0) / D))
        pe = torch.zeros(T, 1, D)
        pe[:, 0, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)
        pe[:, 0, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)
        self.register_buffer('pe', pe)

    def forward(self, x): # x: T, N, D
        x = x + self.pe[:x.size(0)]
        return self.dropout(x)
